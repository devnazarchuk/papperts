# Pappert Bakery Website ‚Äì Bakery Site Modernization

I independently developed a complete, responsive redesign of the **Pappert** bakery website from scratch, using modern technologies: **Next.js (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Framer Motion**, and **next-intl**.

The project was focused on high performance, accessibility (ARIA), internationalization (i18n), and a clean, intuitive mobile-first UX design.

## üîë Key Features:

* üéØ **Dynamic UI** with an animated category slider and role-based content (Customer / Employee / All Categories)
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Optimized architecture**: code splitting, lazy loading, image compression
* üåó **Light/Dark mode** and a structure ready for internationalization
* ‚ôøÔ∏è **Accessible and SEO-friendly markup** following WCAG and Core Web Vitals standards
* üß© **Modular architecture** with planned integration of CMS and admin panel (MVP ‚Üí v1 ‚Üí CMS ‚Üí Backend)

> Although the redesign was not adopted (the company was already working with an external team on a new platform), this project showcases my ability to write production-ready code, design UX interfaces, and create scalable architecture entirely from scratch.

## üß™ Course Project

This project also serves as a practical assignment in my web development education. It includes not only technical implementation but also architectural analysis, UX design, and adaptation for real business use cases.
